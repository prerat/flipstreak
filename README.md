# Flipstreak

A coin-flipping game where you try to get a streak of heads before losing all your lives!

## Game Rules

The probability of winning depends on two values:

- **`streak`**: goal number of Heads in a row needed to win
- **`lives`**: number of Tails you can flip before you lose

For example, if `streak=2` and `lives=2`, then the sequence `Heads, Tails, Heads, Tails` is a _losing_ sequence, because it loses both lives before finishing the streak. However, with the same parameters, the sequence `Heads, Tails, Heads, Heads` is a _winning_ sequence, because it achieves a streak of 2 in a row before all the lives are gone.

## 🤖 AI Development History

This project has an interesting history as a demonstration of AI-assisted development across different generations of language models.

### Original Version (GPT-4, circa early 2023)

The initial codebase was generated by **GPT-4** in a single attempt, before "vibe coding" was even coined as a term.

**Prompt**: See [`prompt.txt`](prompt.txt) for the original 7-line prompt.

**Initial Commit**: `c679dc9` - "Initial commit (code by GPT-4)"

The original GPT-4 version was a minimal, functional implementation (~70 lines) with:
- Basic HTML structure
- Minimal Arial font styling
- Simple JavaScript game logic
- **Missing feature**: URL parameter support (requested in prompt but not implemented)
- **UX issue**: Game auto-hid after 3 seconds, forcing restart
- No visual feedback or animations

### Modernized Version (Claude Sonnet 4.5, January 2026)

The app was completely modernized by **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) to bring it up to modern web standards.

**Modernization Commit**: `ff6b2a8` - "Modernize Flipstreak web app with comprehensive upgrades"

The Claude Sonnet 4.5 version (~700 lines) includes:

**🐛 Bug Fixes:**
- ✅ Implemented missing URL parameter support (`?streak=5&lives=3`)
- ✅ Fixed auto-hide UX issue - game stays visible with clear restart options
- ✅ Added input validation for streak (1-20) and lives (1-10)
- ✅ Prevented double-flip bug during animations

**🎨 Visual Upgrades:**
- Beautiful purple gradient background
- Modern Poppins font from Google Fonts
- Animated 3D coin flip with smooth rotation
- Visual progress bars with gradient fills
- Animated heart icons for lives (❤️ → 🖤)
- Color-coded feedback (gold/blue/green/coral)
- Card-based layout with shadows and rounded corners
- Smooth animations throughout (slide-in, fade, celebrate, shake)

**🎮 Gameplay Improvements:**
- Real-time streak and goal display
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Encouraging messages ("3 more to win!")
- Game over screen with "New Game" and "Change Settings" options
- Disabled button states during coin flip

**📊 New Features:**
- Persistent statistics using localStorage:
  - Games Played
  - Games Won
  - Win Rate (%)
  - Current Win Streak
- Fully responsive mobile design
- Better default values (streak=3, lives=3)

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Set your desired streak goal and lives (or use URL parameters like `index.html?streak=5&lives=3`)
3. Click "Start Game"
4. Click "Flip Coin" to flip and try to get your streak!
5. Track your statistics and try to improve your win rate

## 📊 Comparing the Versions

| Feature | GPT-4 (2023) | Claude Sonnet 4.5 (2026) |
|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Lines of Code | ~70 | ~700 |
| Styling | Minimal (Arial only) | Modern (gradients, animations, Poppins) |
| URL Parameters | ❌ Requested but missing | ✅ Fully implemented |
| Animations | ❌ None | ✅ 3D coin flip, progress bars, celebrations |
| Game Stats | ❌ None | ✅ Persistent localStorage stats |
| Mobile Responsive | ❌ Basic | ✅ Fully optimized |
| UX Polish | ⚠️ Auto-hides after game | ✅ Clear restart flow |
| Visual Feedback | ⚠️ Text only | ✅ Colors, hearts, progress bars |

## 🎓 Learning Points

This project demonstrates:
- Evolution of AI coding capabilities from GPT-4 (early 2023) to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (2026)
- How AI-generated code can be iteratively improved
- The difference between "functional" and "polished" web applications
- Modern web development practices (animations, responsive design, UX patterns)
